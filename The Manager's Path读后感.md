"The manager's path" 读后感或者说是读后无感， 还在youtube上搜索些 Camille Fournier 视频看，也没有特别打动我的，不过可以看看。在美亚写了评论 [The Manager's Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change](https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8)

https://workplace.stackexchange.com/questions/168942/what-is-a-typical-day-like-for-middle-management-with-a-team-around-10-engineers 自己删除，以及被删.

SO 几个值得看看的问题，前两个也被关了，SO 基于opinion based关闭问题真的很无语。

[I'm a manager. How can I improve work relationships and communication with programmers?](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/92862/im-a-manager-how-can-i-improve-work-relationships-and-communication-with-progr)

[Reasons Programmers Leave](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/49806/reasons-programmers-leave)

[My manager told me I should feel comfortable about telling him if I want to leave the company. Should I tell him?](https://workplace.stackexchange.com/questions/90692/my-manager-told-me-i-should-feel-comfortable-about-telling-him-if-i-want-to-leav)

意犹未尽 又找来美亚评价高的 The Making of a Manager: What to Do When Everyone Looks to You 看看有点意外这两本书都是女性作者写的。
