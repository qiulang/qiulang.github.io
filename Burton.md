When I googled "sir richard francis burton biography" the top result about the biography is this https://burtoniana.org/biography/. It wrote these words interestingly,

> The most important archival biography is Mary Lovell's **A Rage to Live** (1996). Jon Godsall's important biography of Burton, **The Tangled Web (2008)** is a useful dose of skepticism. **Byron Farwell's crisp Burton** (1963) is the most balanced and critically detached. Fawn Brodie's The **Devil Drives** (1967) is still very readable. **All biographies of Burton should be read skeptically** as many of his biographers tend to accept the stories that surround his life uncritically.

The best seller on amazon about Burton seems to be Rice Edward's **Captain Sir Richard Francis Burton: A Biography**. But the link said

> Highly imaginative but dubious. Sold well, but seems to have used an interpolation technique to deduce 'facts'.

So far I have read Byron Farwell's "Burton: A Biography of Sir Richard Francis Burton" (one of reasons is the link says it is **the most balanced and critically detached**)

So can someone recommend any other books? I also find that all these books don't get enough ratings on amazon, even Rice Edward's book only gets 87 ratings.

BTW, English is my second language so Mary Lovell's **A Rage to Live**, which has 910 pages is quite a challenge for me. I would like to pass that one.
