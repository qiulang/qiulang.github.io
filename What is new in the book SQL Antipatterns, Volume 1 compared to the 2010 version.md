### What is new in the book "SQL Antipatterns, Volume 1" compared to the 2010 version?

I’m the author of both the 2010 edition and the 2022 edition of “SQL Antipatterns”.

For the 2022 edition, I made many improvements on existing content:

- Reviewed all errata reported by readers since 2010, and corrected the code and text for each case.
- Edited text in every chapter to make explanations and examples more clear.
- Updated and re-tested all code examples to work with current versions of software (MySQL 8.0 in most cases).
- Added code examples for modern SQL usage, like recursive CTE queries and window functions.
- Rewrote most PHP code examples to Python 3, because the popularity of Python has exceeded PHP in recent years.
- Re-designed all figures using OmniGraffle and open source fonts.

I also wrote the following as brand new content:

- 15 new “mini-antipatterns” which are added to the end of chapters. These are not as long as a full chapter; they are each 1–2 pages long. They are intended to be good advice to avoid common mistakes and make your SQL development habits better.
- One new antipattern chapter on stored procedures.
- A special double-length chapter about foreign keys, describing all the types of mistakes I’ve seen users make when defining foreign keys. The first chapter covers general foreign key mistakes that apply to any implementation of SQL. The second chapter covers mistakes that apply specifically to MySQL.

As with any book publication, I asked other SQL developers and database experts in my network to help by reviewing the content and giving feedback. I made many improvements taking into account the feedback from my expert peers. So the revised book has been through this technical review process twice.

Finally, the publisher’s professional book indexer created a new index for the back of the book. I don’t know how much this is a selling point, but I think the new index is an improvement.
