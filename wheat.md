[Did Plato and Socrates actually discuss picking the largest wheat in a wheat field?](https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/69678/did-plato-and-socrates-actually-discuss-picking-the-largest-wheat-in-a-wheat-fie)

I notice that the story about Socrates and Plato discussed picking the largest wheat in a wheat field when you only have one chance has circulated for a while.

The English version I read, e.g. like this one [Love, Marriage, Happiness, Affair, and Life](https://diysar.medium.com/love-marriage-happiness-affair-and-life-21576fde8758) used that as a metaphor for love and marriage.

The Chinese version even appeared in a primary school [textbook](https://baike.baidu.com/item/最大的麦穗/8780373) (titled "The largest wheat"), but used that as a metaphor for seizing the opportunity.

But I always doubt that dialog actually happened. I read just a little of the [Socratic dialogues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_dialogue), so I can't say for sure.

So does this really appear in one of Plato's dialogues?



Think if there were any rice fields in Greece (or, more generally, Mediterranean) at the time of Plato. [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_rice_cultivation#Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_rice_cultivation#Europe) 



If you haven't seen a lot of these like we have I suppose it might not be obvious, but the "I saw this on the internet somewhere" is a huge tel-tale sign of a made up story, as is the attribution to someone A-list famous to mooch off their reputation to enhance its own. AKA an [apocryphal story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocrypha). I think its more reasonable to assume any such story is false, until shown otherwise.



This is probably a better fit for the Skeptics site. A very similar question was recently answered there: [skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/39843/…](https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/39843/are-socrates-3-tests-from-a-historical-source)



Also come to [latin.stackexchange.com](https://latin.stackexchange.com/) where you have plenty of people who are familiar with ancient Greek literature.



If you want to check Plato's view about love, the major dialogue is The Symposium, with a smaller contribution in Phaedrus. None of those have an excerpt like the one you linked, which doesn't look like a Plato's dialogue at all and it doesn't correlate with Plato's theories (the major form of love is a rational one, based on harmony and humans yearn for goodness and try to find it in their loving companions). 



Then why wheat and not, say, barley or grape? Or why Socrates and Plato and not Confucius and his (unnamed) student and a rice field? The thing is: All what we know about conversations between Socrates and Plato is what's written in Plato's books (and even that is likely to be semifictional). A better question then is if some version of the story about the **wheat field** appears in Plato's writings. You can decide for yourself by browsing Plato's "Complete works." If you really mean "wheat" then the answer will be negative.



@Qiulang邱朗, the potential value of asking on Skeptics is that someone might be able to find the origin of this parable, as they did for that other story that was misattributed to Socrates. But if that's not interesting to you, I wouldn't bother reposting the question.

Well, there's no source for the claim, so it doesn't fit I'm afraid. You were given incorrect advice it appears.

Our format on skeptics doesn't deal with this sort of question. I fear it would be off-topic on our [Philosophy](https://philosophy.stackexchange.com/) stack too (though I could be wrong, and you should check for yourself). There's a possibility our [History of Science and Mathematics](https://hsm.stackexchange.com/) stack might take it, or maybe [Literature](https://literature.stackexchange.com/), but again you'd need to check before posting.

问了困扰我已久的问题，感受是 mix feeling

https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/53799/do-the-most-popular-college-books-in-the-us-include-the-communist-manifesto 有个人挺好，但是。。。



This seems like a question you'd probably want to ask at SE.Academics more than SE.Skeptics, since you seem to be interested in why such works might be popularly read rather than just if they are.

That said, just to comment a bit:



The most popular books are probably those that tend to appear in the most common classes, e.g. English 101 or Writing 101 (where a "*101*" class is a basic, high-school-level-ish introductory class. In fact, it seems pretty common for students skip 101-classes, especially 101-classes in their major.). Often such classes are geared toward going easy on students while they get used to the college lifestyle; they're rarely challenging classes, but rather often easy-A's for most students.

Point being that a list of most-popular-books won't generally reflect serious study. It's actually kinda the opposite -- more serious texts tend to have fewer readers. For example, an advanced text about some esoteric mathematical theory might have few folks actually read through it, while a book about how-to-use-Google might be relatively popular.

**Note 2:** Western liberal-education tends to not care about what people believe; rather, students are supposed to learn and explore new ideas -- we're not generally too concerned with what students come to believe, so long as they're honest, objective, and well-intentioned.

For example, we're not generally scared that students might embrace, say, Communism -- if they do so after thorough study and examination of the facts. Likewise, we're not generally too concerned with getting everyone to agree on everything; openness to diverse perspectives is celebrated.

**Note 3:** A major opinion among historical anti-Communists in America was that Communism was a well-intentioned system that backfires in practice. Those who believed that may want to expose young students to Communism early -- so they can explore it and perhaps even temporarily embrace it before maturing out of it.

Point being that even anti-Communists may even want students to read works like those by Marx. They might want students to pick up on what they'd perceive to be Marx's shallowness and naivety, sorta like giving students a vaccination.

(Likewise, folks who like Communism may want people to read ["*Atlas Shrugged*"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_Shrugged) for similar reasons.)
