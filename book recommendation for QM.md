### [Book recommendation for Evolution of Quantum Theory](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/678894/book-recommendation-for-evolution-of-quantum-theory)



Can anyone recommend some good book(s) on **Evolution of Quantum Theory**, focusing on **history**, not necessarily on explaining the technical/math part. So my question is different from [Good book on the history of Quantum Mechanics?](https://physics.stackexchange.com/q/18632/) I have checked the question and all the answers there, although the question title is about the history, the question itself and answers are more about the technical part.

The book I have read includes,

1. "[Quantum: Einstein, Bohr, and the Great Debate about the Nature of Reality](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0393078299)" by Manjit Kumar
2. "[Uncertainty: Einstein, Heisenberg, Bohr, and the Struggle for the Soul of Science](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1400079969)" by David Lindley
3. "[Quantum Enigma: Physics Encounters Consciousness](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B005H5O1DU)" by Bruce Rosenblum
4. [Entanglement: The Greatest Mystery in Physics](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1568582323) by Aczel, Amir D

They all did some good job in explain some part of the history, but not the overall history. So if I were to recommend just ONE book I won't recommend any of them.

Actually I find "[Introducing Quantum Theory A Graphic Guide](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1840468505)" does a decent job for that but I was hoping to find a more detailed version of it.

Someone recommends "[The Quantum Story A History in 40 Moments](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0199566844)" but I have not read it. Any other recommendation?





A few books that you may consider to learn about the evolution of quantum physics are:

1. "The Conceptual Development of Quantum Mechanics" by Max Jammer.
2. "Quantum: A Guide for the Perplexed" by Jim Al-Khalili.
3. "The Strange Story of the Quantum" by Banesh Hoffmann.
4. "Quantum Mechanics: The Theoretical Minimum" by Leonard Susskind and George Hrabovsky.
5. "Quantum Mechanics: An Introduction" by R. Shankar.

These books provide an in-depth overview of the development of quantum physics, covering the key concepts, theories, and experiments that have shaped this field.
