It is hard to know which was the greater task, discovering the sources of the Nile or discovering just who did that, as Tim Jeal goes to heroic lengths to establish his hero, Speke, as the un-credited one. It is a dramatic tale, and Jeal's sense of injustice having been done in this determination, he makes sure you get the correct picture; being the author, he has taken on the roles of judge and jury, infusing it with new layers of passion. This skews the evidence always in favor of Speke and to the detriment of most anyone else, particularly Sir Richard Burton.

It appears to start with Speke's unhappiness at being refused permission by the British Resident to explore in Africa, until Burton is on the horizon, and he is told he may go into the interior, IF he can get Burton to sponsor him (p 45). His unspoken grudge at being beholden to Burton spurs his every observation, the sting of ingratitude like the bite of an asp, and poisons the venture, as well as Jeal's retelling: although Burton desires to have no engagement with the prevalence of slaves, they are called porters or bearers in relation to Speke, but become slaves when it is a very sick Burton they carry (p.83)
When the chronometers fall out of commission, no blame is leveled (p 73), though it was Speke's job to mind them (p 58); Jeal loves to use hindsight to excoriate Burton for such lapses of judgment as not buying enough cloth or beads for trade (p68), yet when it is noted that Speke `perfectly well knew' Somalis were a grave danger in the area of their campsite and did not speak up (p 51), there is no note about his failure, although they became victims of a vicious Somali raid in the morning and were lucky to escape though badly wounded. The author is so competitive on Speke's behalf that Burton's writing of "my companion" in his journal is brought up as a sign of horrendous snobbery(78). Jeal enjoys jotting down as conclusive evidence a future hypothesis, even though it turns out to be false: after carriers desert and fresh ones are found, Burton is called up as the one who would not have paid them, no responsibility of Speke's.

When their differences of opinion come to a head, and Burton determines they must go to Tanganyika first, contrary to Speke's desire, much is made of the oppressive privilege the leader took, and nowhere does Jeal chide Speke for his selfish digression by noting the Royal Geographic Society had mandated they "go first to Tanganyika, then head West...", no this is simply called a "sorry decision" (85).
"When the moment of choice had come he had lacked the self-destructive courage and obsessive determination of a true explorer. In the same circumstances, Livingstone, Stanley and Speke, who had volunteered, would all have been prepared to reach the river. But the sybaritic Burton `had had enough of canoe traveling', and that had been the end of it. " (92) So Speke is raised to a grandiose level, and Burton cast down, as Jeal writes the story, conveniently leaving aside some of the facts.

It must have been hard for Burton to manage such a venture with this Speke's second-guessing every move, undermining, doubt dogging every path. Jael's attitude makes reading this a trial, like being whipsawed in the middle of a family quarrel, and his aggressive stance towards Burton made me doubt Speke as envious, small minded, and selfish, jealous of the greater abilities and spirit of Burton.
"Speke was left to ruefully reflect that without the encumbrance of a sick leader, he could have gone on to Uganda with Musa Mzuri"....Burton is described as flogging the slaves, as well as being too sick to walk. (103) on a journey that began 26 September, "Early in October, Speke was struck by a serious illness..." ie a few days later. It seems Speke had all of a few days to be rueful about his overly sick leader imagining the heights he could have attained...another rather spurious entry on his behalf by Jeal.

On and on Jeal goes vituperatively and sarcastic about Burton, applying such words as : "liar, scared, ill at ease, never comfortable, contradictory, imperialist,"
To one who was both a consummate outsider to convention, and a brilliant joiner of the esoteric. Burton knew Sanskrit, Persian, Hindustani, Gujarati, Marathi, and French, though he left Oxford having been considered a poor linguist, not caring so much for Latin and ancient Greek. When in Africa he learns Arabic, Jeal dismisses the effort as Burton "got" Arabic.

As the story continues with Stanley's endeavor it becomes clear that Burton was not so out of line, as Livingstone and he had exactly the same travails with carriers, "Arab" slavers, local chiefs, and sicknesses in the jungle, and dealt with them in identical manners. They of course are granted Jeal's sympathy, however.

The side-taking continues with the next lot:
Petherick is called treacherous' for appearing to have been 5 days late in actually coming to meet up with Stanley, although he had left the the boats as promised, and he had had to wait 7 whole months for Stanley's arrival. Petherick is denigrated for his disastrously late accounts to the RGS (188), though Speke did not repay Burton for his share of the expenses for over a year (119), and it was his brother Ben who paid for Jack. Not a qualm to Jeal.

Who could have proofed this, when such neologisms as `enthused' are used (65, and elsewhere) and several inappropriate knee-jerk clichÃ©s, even a few completely inarticulate paragraphs. Isabel Arundell meets Burton and "promptly fell in love" (63), just on cue? Facing insurrection, Baker placed a bed outside his tent, and a lot of guns upon it. This somehow faced down the mutineers (215-216) , but sounds as if the cart is being put before the horse.
Maybe it was given the go on account of its sensational slant.

How is it that Florence the slave purchased in Africa by Baker has blonde hair (228)?

There are some passages that seem to be very well conceived, about which direction the explorers went and in which sequence. The fascinating odd fact of Livingstone's son having fought and died at Gettysburg, and Stanley himself having fought at Shiloh, as well as in the Union Army does help inform their father/son relationship. Who would have thought?

It would be very interesting to find out just who these "Arab slavers" were, terrorizing Central Africa, and to whom could they sell any slaves, as late as this.
It had seemed that the local Africans simply called them `Arab' because they came from the coast; what race or nationality were they? Too bad this is unexplained.

Whoever did discover the Nile's origin, and whether anyone really did, today one has to wonder why anyone cares; maybe all the trouble they went to purely glorifies the tale.
