You won't learn much if you were an experienced manager. As a matter of fact I don't think I learn anything from it.

There are 2 reasons I read this book and "The Manager's Path" by Camille Fournier. First, I am Chinese, working in Beijing. I am a manager for about 15 years, mostly works for local companies so I would like to see if there is any newly developed best practice(s) in software industry, especially in silicon valley. I notice both authors are female. I find that interesting, thinking maybe they will provide some insights I don't think of. My role model is Ernest Shackleton. His leadership style is the one I look up to. I read many books of Shackleton so I told myself maybe this time try a female writer. But I have to say I am disappointed with both of books. All they wrote are just common sense, I don't see anything new or memorable. For this book after finishing it all I can remember is that "lame" example of lemonade stand. 

I also feel that the author doesn't have many experiences in deal with difficult team member or boss even though she wrote a chapter called "The No Asshole Rule". To me the toxic work environment like the office in Dunder Mifflin, the stupid boss like Michael Scott or troublesome colleague like Dwight Schrute is not joke but a reality occasionally. How do you deal with that a must have skill as experienced manager. I do't see author has enough experience of that. 


On the other hand I am sure if I should give 2 stars because I can see the author did put a lot of thought and energy in writing it. She didn't just churned out a book. I think it is probably useful for the first time manager.
